      <div class="about1">
        <p>I’m a life long learner and a career changer. After spending five years in my last role I was ready for
          something new, so I left my job and completed the Front-End Web Development program at The Iron Yard. My first
          introduction to coding was in 1999 when my best friend and I made (terrible) *N Sync fan websites on Angelfire.
          I’d been interested in coding ever since, but I thought it was something that only people who were really
          good at math could do! </p>

	      <p>While I was at The Iron Yard I also started learning about UX design. I have a degree in anthropology, so the
          combination of  social science and web development meets in the middle with UX. I’ve been taking classes online
          in my spare time to learn more about it, and my focus has shifted from development to design.</p>

      <div class="about2">
        <p>I’m currently doing two internships: one is for an athletic recruitment startup called
          <a href=“http://axcesscoaching.com”>Axcess Coaching</a>, where I’ve been helping them build and update their
          site (which is on WordPress), and the other is for a lifestyle/adventure blog called <a href=“http://kaizening.com”>
          Kaizening</a> where I’ve been helping with everything from UX to beautifying signup and contact forms to
          improving SEO.</p>

        <p> I love being useful, and my experience in multiple departments means whether you're in healthcare, tech,
          marketing, event planning, HR, or accounting I've got you covered. My previous positions have taught me how use
          use my organizational skills and natural focus and self-motivation to be a great employee.</p>
