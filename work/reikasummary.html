        <h1>Reika Summary</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>Reika is an app that lets people organize their travel information easily. The focus was on creating a product
          that's simple to use and will make it less of a hassle to find the address of the hotel you're staying at when
          you're going through customs.</p>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <p>This is my capstone project for a UX bootcamp. I like traveling, and there's a lot of stuff to plan for
          international trips, so I wanted to make something that would help keep everything organized and in one place.</p>
        <h2>What was the result?</h2>
        <p>This is a class project, so it probably won't end up being a live app.</p>
        <h2>What was my role?</h2>
        <p>I did everything myself, from the early research to the designs. (But lots of nice people answered my questions
          and gave me great feedback.)</p>
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I learned that keeping things simple is really helpful and that little things matter. I also found out that
          there's an app called <a href="http://tripit.com" target="_blank" class="links">TripIt</a> that you can use for
          travel organization in real life.</p>
