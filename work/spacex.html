          <div class="text">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In September of 2017 Elon Musk announced that SpaceX has plans for commercial flights using the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFR_(rocket)" target="_blank">BFR</a> on Earth (you can
              <a href="https://youtu.be/zqE-ultsWt0" target="_blank">watch their teaser video here</a>) that will be able
              to make long distance flights much faster than they are now - a flight from LA to NYC will only take 25 minutes!
              When this happens they'll need a way for people to book flights, so this is a concept for their flight booking site.</p>
            <p>SpaceX is a future-focused company, but they're also focused on getting things done quickly. They have a
              sense of humor (there's a Tesla-driving Starman somewhere in space right now), but they work really hard.
              I'm creating this concept site through the lense of my knowledge about SpaceX, but I'm not actually talking
              with anyone who works there, and I don't have access to any internal data. This means that this site is
              probably going to miss out on some important pieces that the real SpaceX team would know to add. In light
              of that I'm doing this project to focus on the process of creating for an established brand rather than
              making it a perfect fit. </p>
            <p>It's currently still in progress, so if you're just here to see screenshots of the finished product then
              they don't exist yet, sorry! Check back in a week or two for more.</p>
            <p>I'm not an employee of SpaceX (but I'd like to be!), so all references to SpaceX and the BFR are their
              property. Please don't sue me!</p>

          <div class="text">
            <h2>Survey</h2>
            <p>I did a survey on Typeform to learn about how people book flights online and what their challenges are.
              This project is to make an in-house flight booking site, so I asked about how people searched for flights
              and what they like and dislike about the sites they use.</p>
            <p>People enjoy the flexibility and ease of booking flights online, but they also have some issues with the
              way sites present flights and flight information.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"Not always easy to specify departure times as well as dates" - Survey Respondent #4</li>
                <li>"I don't think that there's a way around this, but having to list airport by code can be annoying.
                  Airlines and third-party sites are great about identifying these for you though. It's not always super
                  easy to search multiple outbound airports." - Survey Respondent #6</li>
                <li>"A lot of the sites make you go back in inconvenient ways when you want to make a change to a booking
                  request. I like seeing the full estimated price of a flight before I commit." - Survey Respondent #8</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These are important things to think about. Providing clarity about what's included and making it easy
                to specify preferences, add filters, and make updates could be the difference between a person leaving
                the site or booking a flight.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of places for people to book flights online, so I looked at some common sites with different
              specialties to learn about how they've presented their screens. These sites have likely done a lot of
              research on what works and what doesn't, even though they might have done their reviews with a marketing
              focus and not as much of a UX focus. A good site balances both the user's needs and the company's needs,
              so knowing what works for other companies is important for this project.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text">
            I did in-depth reviews of three sites:
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="text">
              <h3><a href="http://www.virginatlantic.com" target="_blank">Virgin Airlines</a></h3>
          </div>
              <div class="photos">
                <a href="../images/spaceVirgin.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/spaceVirgin.png" alt="screenshot of Virgin Atlantic's home page"></a>
                <a href="../images/spaceVirginresults.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/spaceVirginresults.png" alt="screenshot of Virgin Atlantic's results page"></a>
              </div>
              <div class="text">
                <h4>Home Page</h4>
                <p>Virgin is a high class airline with a good reputation. Their site is clean with a lot of white space
                  around the text. Currently they're promoting return trips from New York, so they're using an image of
                  NYC with a prominate CTA to intice people to learn more.</p>
                <p>Their search field appears below that, and shows up above the fold even on my Macbook Air, which
                  means they expect most visitors are coming to their site to book flights. </p>
                <h4>Calendar Page</h4>
                <p>They don't include dates on their search form because the next step in the process is a calendar page
                  that has users click their dates to highlight them. It would be interesting to see if they've done
                  A/B testing to check whether users prefer this format or if they'd rather have it be part of the original
                  search. They're splitting the search process into two pages, which might keep people from getting
                  overwhelmed, but it also adds an opportunity for things to go wrong, especially if a user is on an
                  unreliable internet connection.</p>
                <h4>Results Page</h4>
                <p>Their purchase page shows the flight options for each day as well as the prices for the levels of
                  service. There doesn't seem to be a way to only show the flight options for one service type (all the
                  Premium Economy flight options, for example), but it's interesting that they have the option to watch
                  a video showing the amenities of each type of service. They also hide most of their filter options,
                  which means the screen is uncluttered and focuses on the flights until a user specifically asks for
                  more filters.</p>

            <div class="text">
              <h3><a href="http://southwest.com" target="_blank">Southwest Airlines</a></h3>

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <h4>Home Page</h4>
                <p>Southwest is a lower cost airline with a fun personality. Their site has a gradient background that
                  starts out as dark (I'm curious what the decision making process was for this), and then uses the brand
                  colors (blue, red, and yellow) underneath.</p>
                <p>They have a brightly colored CTA for spring break trips, and the flight search is under that. Unlike
                  Virgin they have all the search fields (locations, dates, and the number of travelers) in one place,
                  so when a user clicks the Search button it takes them directly to the page that shows the available flights.</p>
                <h4>Results</h4>
                <p>The results page has a lot of white space, so there's a lot of information but it doesn't seem overwhelming.
                One thing that Southwest does differently than other sites is that they show the flights in time order
                (the results start with the earliest flight of the day), rather than in a recommended order or by price.</p>
              </div>

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <h4>Home Page</h4>
                 <p>Momondo is a site that helps people find the cheapest possible flights for their trip. They search
                   other flight booking sites and put them all in one place. Their site has a dark theme, and the focus
                   is on the flight search. Since they link to lots of sites they don't focus on specific promotions.
                   Above the fold they also have pictures of people traveling.</p>
                <h4>Results Page</h4>
                  <p>The results page still has a dark background, but it looks very colorful. It has a lot going on,
                    and most of the filters are shown without someone clicking on them. They also have a sort of bar
                    graph/calendar above the results that shows the lowest price on each date. Since Momondo is focused
                    on cheap flights this makes sense, but on other sites having a separate page for a calendar view can
                    also work.</p>
                <h4>Purchasing</h4>
                  <p>Momondo doesn't sell their own tickets, so they send users to the site(s) of the airline(s) that
                    are selling the flights.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <h2>Personas</h2>
              <p>Lots of types of people book flights online. Since SpaceX will be offering really fast flights, the
               target audiences for the site will be slightly different than other airlines. I have two personas - Casey
               travels for business and wants to spend less time flying, and Jamie travels less frequently but loves new and
               exciting things.</p>
              <p>I've done a lot of reading about how to effectively make personas, and chose to go for a different approach
                on these. I'm focused on what their actual "jobs to be done" are, and not on demographic information. (I
                used Marcel van Remmerden's
                <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/my-google-design-exercise-pet-adoption-8d91db732f11#43d2" target="_blank">
                  Google design exercise</a> as a reference for this type of persona.)</p>
              <h4>Casey</h4>
              <p>"I travel internationally on business a lot and spend tons of time on planes. Being able to get across
                the world in under an hour will make a huge difference in my life. It means I'll get to spend more time at home
                with my family and in the office with my team instead of in the air. And being able to sleep in real beds
                (at home or on the road) instead of trying to get comfortable on a plane will me be more alert at meetings
                and in presentations. Quicker travel means a better life."</p>
              <h4>Jamie</h4>
              <p>"I like to go on one big international trip a year, and the travel to and from there is always such a
                hassle. When I'm booking the trip I spend a bunch of time trying to find the perfect combination of short
                travel times and low prices. If I can get to my destination in half an hour then I can spend less time
                planning ahead of time, and I'll have more time to enjoy myself because I'll get to where I'm going faster.
                I also spent my whole childhood wanting to be an astronaut, so flying with SpaceX is super exciting because
                it feels like we live in the future!"</p>

            <p>Most flight booking sites have similar structures. SpaceX is a future-focused company, but it's
              important to have consistency in the purchase process. Users who are excited about short-duration flights
              will still be skeptical if they don't feel the site is trustworthy. I created a simple IA for the site that
               focuses on the pages, and I'll add more to it as I start to design.</p>

            <p>Having lots of other sites for flight booking helped me make a high level overview of what a
              page of this site should look like. I also used the feedback I got from people who took the survey.</p>
            <p>Several people told me they find it difficult to get information about what's included in the price before
              they purchase. I'm trying out adding a flight info page that explains what they're paying for.</p>

              laying out all the information so it's easy to compare. Several people said that was one of their favorite
              things about booking flights online.</p>

              this type of wireframe. I focused on simplicity for two reasons: 1. SpaceX flights are different than
              people are used to, so having everything be easy to understand could help them feel more trusting, and 2.
              any time a person needs to pay for something it's good to provide clarity.</p>

            <p>I used InVision to make a simple prototype so I could have people try out the process and tell me whether
              or not it worked for them. Since I added additional pages beyond what most flight booking sites have I was

            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>I had a few of the people who filled out my survey do a run through of the prototype. Since I didn't
              include edge cases in the prototype this testing was more focused on how people felt about the additional
              pages (like the Flight Info page), and also to get general feedback on what they felt worked and didn't work.</p>
            <p>I got some great responses from this. Several of the people I asked to review it are UX designers (or UX students),
              and I loved talking with them. I'm the only person working on this project, so it added a little bit of
              collaboration into my process. Their feedback blended with non-designer feedback will make a much better
              second round of designs.</p>
            <p>Some of the main things I learned were:
              <ul>
                <li>the way I listed flight prices was confusing to some people (but not to everyone)</li>
                <li>I'm missing a way to change flights on the Flight Info page</li>
                <li>there are things I need to improve about the Flyer's Info page (like the non-US phone number link)</li>
                <li>people like the bar at the top that shows the steps, but they pointed out that I didn't add anything
                  to show which step they're on</li>
