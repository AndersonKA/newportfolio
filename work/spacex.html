            <p>In September of 2017 Elon Musk announced that SpaceX has plans for commercial flights using the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFR_(rocket)" target="_blank">BFR</a> on Earth (you can
              <a href="https://youtu.be/zqE-ultsWt0" target="_blank">watch their teaser video here</a>) that will be able
              to make long distance flights much faster than they are now. When that happens they'll need a way for people
              to book flights, so this is a concept for their flight booking site.</p>
            <p>I'm not an employee of SpaceX (but I'd like to be!), so all references to SpaceX and the BFR are their
              property. Please don't sue me!</p>
