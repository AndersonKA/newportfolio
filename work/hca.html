        </header>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>I'm currently working at HCA Healthcare (an owner of hundreds of hospital facilities and
              specialty sites) on a contract project to make their websites more accessible. I'm part of a team
            in the Web Shared Services department. My job is to perform audits and updat the issues we find so the
            sites will work well for all users.</p>
            <p>The Web Shared Services department currently most of HCA's 14 divisions, and our accessibility project
              is in charge of working on all of the division, facility, and specialty sites. By the end of this project
              we'll have improved accessibility on several hundred sites.</p>
            <p>We have a team of five "digital content specialists", two project managers, and an accessibility QA specialist.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>What We Work On</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>There are a lot of things we review and update for each site:
              <ul>
                <li>videos on HCA Healthcare Youtube channels need to have captions (not the auto-generated ones)
                  or a transcript for videos without a person speaking</li>
                <li>all PDF documents need to have appropriate tags and reading order for screenreader users</li>
                <li>short, text-based PDFs get turned into HTML pages (because HTML is easier to make screenreader friendly)</li>
                <li>links are changed to make sure they're clear ("read more" gets updated to "our oncology team", for example),
                  since screenreader users can navigate a page by links</li>
                <li>each site's branding is reviewed for color contrast</li>
                <li>any old Flash content is marked for removal</li>
                <li>HTML gets updated to remove things like iframes</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Tools We Use</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>HCA uses a CMS platform called <a href="https://dotcms.com/" target="_blank">dotCMS</a> to house the sites.
              It's got some similarities to other CMS platforms
            like WordPress, but it's designed for enterprises with a lot of sites.</p>
            <p>We use <a href="https://siteimprove.com/" target="_blank">Siteimprove</a> to run audits on the websites so
            we don't have to manually check each of the hundreds of thousands of pages individually. </p>
            <p><a href="https://brailleworks.com/">Brailleworks</a> updates PDF documents for screenreader accessibility.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.rev.com/">Rev.com</a> creates captions and transcripts for Youtube videos.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a> a screen reader that we use for testing sites</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/monitor/">axe Monitor</a> is an auditing tool that looks for accessibility
              issues on lots of sites and pages at the same time</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Other Work</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>The accessibility project has sprints for each division, which means some of the time we're waiting on
              the facilities or the vendors and we're less busy. During those times I've worked on:
              <ul>
                <li>Find Care, a large scale project to replace outdated "service" pages on each site with more cohesive
                  "specialties" pages</li>
                <li>Training new members of the accessibility team</li>
                <li>Helping the ticketing team when their queue gets too long</li>
                <li>Reading articles, watching webinars, and taking online courses to learn more about accessibility
                  so I can contribute more to our project</li>
              </ul>

            </p>
          </div>



          <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
            <div class="text">
              <p>Before I started this role I had some basic knowledge about color contrast, only having one H1 per page,
                and that people use screenreaders. I've been able to get much more in-depth about
                how easy it can be to create websites that work for all users.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>I've also gotten to experience using a screenreader myself (I have to listen to it at non-superhuman speeds
                though!) - <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a> is a free screenreader created by blind developers,
                so it's a great one to try out.</p>
              <p>There's always more to learn, so even after my contract ends I'll still be reading articles to keep up
                with the best way to design sites. The things I've learned here will help me create better digital products
                in the future.</p>
