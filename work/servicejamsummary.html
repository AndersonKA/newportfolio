        <h1>Global Service Design Jam Summary</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>The Global Service Design Jam is a 48 hour project where teams from all over the world research and prototype
          a product that helps people.</p>
        <h2>Why did I do this project?</h2>
        <p>I joined the Nashville GSJam team and worked with five teammates and five facilitators - I hadn't done any
          type of service design before and I wanted to learn about how the process works.</p>
        <h2>What was my role?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I brainstormed ideas for our project</li>
          <li>I was the notetaker for our guerilla interviews</li>
          <li>I handwrote everything on our app prototype</li>
          <li>I helped come up with the name (Support Link)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What was the process?</h2>
        <p>When the event started we watched a video that revealed the theme for the year (it was the words "yes", "no",
          and "maybe" repeated with a glitchy background). We used that to start
          coming up with ideas, which we did by word associations based on the theme. </p>
        <p>We grouped words into similar categories and ended up choosing teams based on the categories we were most
          interested in. My group was interested in the differences between how people learn in classrooms versus
          life experience. We did interviews with people in downtown Nashville and found that some people focused much
          more on education and were very influenced by life experiences. </p>
        <p>We thought what we learned was interesting, but ended up deciding it wasn't something we could create a
          prototype around (figuring out a way to quantify life experience was a lot for a 48 hour event!), so we were
          lucky that the other team had a much more actionable idea and they were willing to let us join them.</p>
        <p>We worked together as a team to come up with a way to help people who have an immediate need for some type of
          life assistance.</p>
        <h2>What was the result?</h2>
        <p>We created the paper prototype of an app and a cardboard booth that connect people to resources when they need them. Our idea
          is that a group of supporters (charities, local governments, private citizens) will sign up for the service.
          Then a person who needs assistance uses the app or a booth to get in contact with the supporters and can request
          help with anything from housing to healthcare to an urgent financial situation.</p>

        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I didn't know much about service design before, and this was a great way to get involved. I also learned how
          much fun it can be to create a project with a group.</p>
