        <h1>Global Service Design Jam Summary</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>The Global Service Design Jam is a 48 hour project where teams from all over the world research and prototype
          a product that helps people.</p>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <p>I joined the Nashville GSJam team and worked with five teammates and five facilitators to come up with our solution.</p>
        <h2>What was the result?</h2>
        <p>We created the paper prototype of an app and a booth that connect people to resources when they need them. Our idea
          is that a group of supporters (charities, local governments, private citizens) will sign up for the service.
          Then a person who needs assistance uses the app or a booth to get in contact with the supporters and can request
          help with anything from housing to an urgent financial situation.</p>
        <h2>What was my role?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I brainstormed ideas for our project</li>
          <li>I was the notetaker for our guerilla interviews</li>
          <li>I handwrote everything on our app prototype</li>
          <li>I helped come up with the name (Support Link)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I didn't know much about service design before, and this was a great way to get involved. I also learned how
          much fun it can be to create a project with a group.</p>
