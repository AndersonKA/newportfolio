        <h1>Kaizening CTA Summary</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>I did an internship for a wellness/lifestyle blog, and this was a redesign of the CTAs on their WordPress site. </p>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <p>The owner was using a default Mailchimp form for her email signup and contact form. She wanted to increase her
          mailing list's subscriber count.</p>
        <h2>What was my role?</h2>
          <p>I did the research and redesign myself, focusing on what competitors were doing, what the owner wanted to
            achieve, and the feedback I got from blog readers.</p>
        <h2>What was the process?</h2>
          <p>I talked with Lindsey about her goals and ideas for the form. She wanted something that fit better with
            the rest of her blog and that looked more appealing.</p>
          <p>I did some competitive analysis of other lifestyle brand's forms to see what those sites were doing.</p>
          <p>I created a few designs for the form and had the owner and three women who read lifestyle blogs look at them.
            One of the forms was the unanimous winner, so I used CSS to update the actual form in WordPress.</p>
        <h2>What was the result?</h2>
        <p>Within two months of the CTA redesign the email list had grown by 30%.</p>
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>Small changes can lead to big improvements.</p>
