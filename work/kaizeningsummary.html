        <h1>Kaizening CTA Summary</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>I'm doing an internship for a wellness/lifestyle blog, and this is a redesign of the CTAs on their WordPress site. </p>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <p>The owner was using a default Mailchimp form for her email signup and contact form. She wanted to increase her
          mailing list's subscriber count.</p>
        <h2>What was the result?</h2>
        <p>Within two months of the CTA redesign the email list had grown by 30%.</p>
        <h2>What was my role?</h2>
        <p>I did the research and redesign myself, focusing on what competitors were doing, what the owner wanted to
          achieve, and the feedback I got from blog readers.</p>
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>Small changes can lead to big improvements.</p>
