        <h1>SpaceX Concept Site Summary</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a concept for SpaceX's flight booking site.</p>
        <h2>Why am I making this?</h2>
        <p>I really like traveling, but the flights to and from other places aren't my favorite part. In 2017 Elon Musk
           announced plans to have super quick (LA to NYC in 25 minutes) flights around the world. That makes me really
           excited, so I wanted to do some research and come up with a design for what their flight booking site might
           look like. </p>
        <h2>What's the result?</h2>
        <p>This project is still in progress, so there isn't one yet!</p>
        <h2>What's my role?</h2>
        <p>I'm doing all the research and design myself.</p>
        <h2>What am I learning?</h2>
        <p>So far I've learned that doing a project with a lot of competitor sites to compare it to has good and bad
          things about it: on one hand it requires less research because I don't need to come up with an entirely new
          product, but on the other hand it means there's less opportunity to create something that really solves
          problems, because people already have clear ideas about how a flight booking site should work.</p>
