        <h1>SpaceX Concept Site Summary</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a concept for SpaceX's flight booking site.</p>
        <h2>What was my role?</h2>
        <p>I did all the research and design myself.</p>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <p>I really like traveling, but the flights to and from other places aren't my favorite part. In 2017 Elon Musk
           announced plans to have super quick (LA to NYC in 25 minutes) flights around the world. That makes me really
           excited, so I wanted to do some research and come up with a design for what their flight booking site might
           look like. </p>
        <h2>What Was The Process?</h2>
        <p>For intro research I did a survey using Typeform to learn about what people like and dislike when they're
          booking flights. </p>
        <p>Then I did competitive analysis of three sites where you can book flights: Virgin Airlines, Southwest Airlins,
          and Momondo.</p>
        <p>I created two persons in a "jobs to be done" format, which led me to their user flows and the processes that
        different types of users would follow as they move through the site.</p>
        <p>From there I worked on the information architecture of the site, and then created paper prototypes.</p>
        <br><br>

        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>After that I was able to make low-fi wireframes in Balsamiq and upload the screenshots into Invision so I
          could do some user testing. I got some great feedback which led to me making changes in the way flights were
          presented to users when I did the mid-fi wireframes.</p>
          <br><br>
          <div class="photos">

          </div>
          <br><br>
        <h2>What was the result?</h2>
        <p>I created mid-fi wireframes that show how the site would function.</p>
        <div class="photos">
          <a href="../images/spacemidfisearch.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/spacemidfisearch.png" alt="a view of the updated home page"></a>
        </div>



        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I've learned that doing a project with a lot of competitor sites to compare it to has good and bad
          things about it: on one hand it requires less research because I don't need to come up with an entirely new
          product, but on the other hand it means there's less opportunity to create something that really solves
          problems, because people already have expectations about how a flight booking site should work.</p>
