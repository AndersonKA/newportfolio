              <h2>Why I Did This Project</h2>
              <div class="text">
                <p>	Iâ€™m a nerd ðŸ¤“ and I love the TV show Doctor Who. My favorite Doctor Who convention is called Con
                  Kasterborous and itâ€™s held in Huntsville, Alabama. Iâ€™ve been 7 times, but this year it got cancelled
                  :( so I didnâ€™t get to go. I decided to do a fun project to help me keep me from being bummed about
                  it. I have no affiliation with Con Kasterborous and this is just a personal project.</p>
                <p>I naturally gravitate toward the research side of UX (I have a degree in anthropology) and I could
                  use more UI design practice, so this is mainly focused on visual design and there wasnâ€™t as
                  much research or testing involved as I would have done if I wanted to work on the whole UX process.</p>
              </div>
              <h2>What Their Actual Site Is Like</h2>
              <div class="text">
                <p>The convention has a website (<a href="http://conkasterborous.com" target="_blank">conkasterborous.com</a>)
                  with lots of information on it, but as a user of the site I noticed a few things that could be improved.</p>
                  <a href="http://conkasterborous.com" target="_blank"><img src="../images/ConKMain.png" alt="Con K's website"></a>
                <p>There are some general issues with the site that are pretty easy to fix, like an email address that
                doesn't wrap inside of the box it's in. Fixing some of these things will make the site look better and
                add some trustworthiness to it, which is always helpful when you're trying to get someone to pay you
              money.</p>
                <img src="../images/ConKEmail.png" alt="">
                <p><strong>Registration Confusion</strong></p>
                <p>Right now the site has some confusing aspects specifically because it was cancelled after it had
                  been planned. The top banner (that shows up on every page) still has the dates it was originally
                  scheduled for, and thereâ€™s a sidebar section that talks about registering for this year. </p>
                  <img src="../images/ConKRegister.png" alt="">

                <p>When you click on a registration link in the navbar or sidebar it takes you to the registration page,
                  but on that page it talks about registering for the 2018 convention, and doesnâ€™t mention that it isnâ€™t
                  happening in 2019. (As far as I can tell the only place that mentions the cancellation is in the news
                  section on the main page.)</p>
                  <img src="../images/ConKRegistrationPage.png" alt="">
                  <p><strong>Navbar Issues</strong></p>
                  <img src="../images/ConKNav.png" alt="">
                <p>Con K's current nav items are: Registration Form, Con Info, Con Chairs, History, and Contact Us</p>
                <p>Registration is important for a convention, but as a user I didnâ€™t understand why the Registration
                  Form dropdown included the hotel information. Some of the other nav items could be arranged
                  differently - since this is a UI focused project I decided to organize the navbar based on what I found
                  in my competitive analysis, but if this was a UX project I would definitely want to do a
                  card sort to see how other people would organize this type of information.</p>

              <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
              <div class="text">
                <p>I looked at five other conventionsâ€™ sites. Two of them are specifically Doctor Who conventions and
                  the other three are for general nerdy cons.
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://wizardworld.com/" target="_blank">wizardworld.com/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.chicagotardis.com/" target="_blank">chicagotardis.com/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/" target="_blank">gallifreyone.com/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.fantomevents.co.uk/utopia2019/" target="_blank">fantomevents.co.uk/utopia2019/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.londonfilmandcomiccon.com/" target="_blank">londonfilmandcomiccon.com/</a></li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Color Scheme/Visuals</strong></p>
                <p>It seems like sites catering to nerds have darker colored sites (not sure if this is a stereotype of
                  people sitting in dark rooms playing video games?), and Con Kasterborousâ€™ site does as well. </p>
                <p><strong>Nav Items</strong></p>
                <p>Since I knew there were some issues with the navbar I reviewed each of the five competitor sites to
                  see if there were similarities in the nav bars that I could use to help plan. </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Wizard World - Shows, Entertainment, Resources, Exhibitors, News, Buy Tickets</li>
                    <li>Chicago TARDIS - Attend, Guests, Vendors, Artists, What To Do, Updates, About, Past Events,
                      Contact Us, 2018 Photo Ops</li>
                    <li>Gallifrey One - About, Guests, Attendee Guide, Program, Features, Convention Life, Venue, Contact</li>
                    <li>Utopia - Home, About Us, News, Calendar/Events, Gallery, Contact Us, Fantom Publishing</li>
                    <li>London - Home, Guests, Zones, Pre-Order, Event Info, Exhibitors, Other Events, Accessibility</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2>Moodboard</h2>
              <div class="text">
                <p>I collected some pictures of Doctor Who logos and artwork, plus a picture from a previous Con K.
                  The pictures tend to have a general color scheme (most of them are dark blue with orange/gold/purple),
                  which gave me a pretty clear direction to go in as I started thinking about the feel of the design. </p>
                  <img src="../images/ConKMoodboard.png" alt="">
              </div>

              <h2>Style Guide</h2>
              <div class="text">
                <p>The site needs to be accessible for lots of types of users, so I chose Helvetica for the body font
                  (with Arial and sans-serif for back-ups). I used Moon for headers because Doctor Who is a show about
                  space, and it's fun to celebrate that in a font style. I recognize that all caps can be hard to read
                  for some people, so keeping it as just the headers will make it less disruptive.</p>
