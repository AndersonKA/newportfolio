          <h2>Overview: What is this?</h2>
          <p>This is my capstone project for the <a href="https://www.springboard.com/workshops/ux-design" target="_blank">
            Springboard UX bootcamp</a>. It isn't going to be a real app (unless you want to make it into one!).</p>
          <p>I like to travel, but planning for a trip can get overwhelming because there's so much stuff to keep track of.
            I'm on a quest to design an app that makes it easier to stay organized when you're planning a trip.</p>

          <p>It's still in progress, so if you're here to see screenshots of the final product then they don't exist yet
            (sorry!). Check back in a few weeks to see more.</p>

          <h2>Early Research and Findings: Do other people have issues with trip planning?</h2>
          <h3>Does anyone else have this problem?</h3>
          <p>I started this process knowing that I’d like a better way to keep track of all of my trip information. I
            want an app that lets me do trip planning from the vague “Top 10 Things To Do In ______” Pinterest
            posts all the way to the specifics of actually being on the trip. My early research focused on whether this
            is something other people also want.</p>
          <h3>Survey</h3>
          <p>I made a survey on <a href="http://typeform.com/" target="_blank">Typeform</a> to gather general trip
            planning information. You can
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZYfDzwaED7-2CulVLF1aSCNWZARs3UFy_HcETp1iiRE/edit?usp=sharing"
            target="_blank">view the questions I asked on this Google doc</a> or <a href="https://kaeanderson.typeform.com/to/R8hi5y"
            target="_blank">see the survey on Typeform</a>.</p>

          <p>My only criteria for survey participants was that they've planned a trip before, so I didn't focus much on
            demographics. I asked how old they were (to give context to the answers), and how often they went
            on trips. The rest of the questions asked about habits and processes for organizing trip information.</p>
          <p>Here are the main things I learned:</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>A lot of things about the trip planning process are less than ideal, so there are a lot of opportunities
                to make improvements. One of my survey questions asked about general trip planning challenges and the responses
                ranged from long immigration lines to the reliability of reviews.</li>
              <li>Most respondents do at least some trip planning in advance (“some” in the survey meant having their
                transportation, lodging, and several things to do planned in advance).</li>
              <li>Information overload is an issue, both in the context of figuring out where to look for the best
                flights/hotels and also in keeping track of the information once they’ve booked their trip.</li>
              <li>Respondents find it challenging to plan if they’re traveling with groups (this wasn’t something I had
                specifically asked about - several people included it in their open responses).</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="../images/Typeform1.png" alt="screenshot of survey results that shows most people do some planning for their trips">
            <img src="../images/Typeform2.png" alt="screenshot of survey results that shows people use multiple methods to keep track of trip information">
          </p>

          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <p>After doing the survey I wanted to ask some follow up questions to get more specific info, so I did interviews
            with five people who had filled out the survey. </p>
          <p>I asked open-ended questions about trip planning, and also talked about how they deal with group travel,
            since I didn't ask any questions about that in the survey. </p>

          <h3>Direction After Early Research</h3>
          <p>The answer to my original question “Does anyone else have this problem?” is yes, so I know that’s a place
            to start, but I learned that most people don’t want to keep track of everything from the beginning of
            trip planning. Most people said they only want the information they’ll actually need on the trip.</p>
            <br><br>
          <p>Responses to an open-ended question in the survey about trip planning challenges included things like:
            <div class="indent"><span class="quote">“</span>everything is booked separately, so it can be hard to have
              a single snapshot of your whole itinerary unless you make something yourself - Survey Respondent #2 </div>
              <br>
              and
              <br>
            <div class="indent"><br><span class="quote">“</span>Keeping all of the information organized. Especially
              if its a trip with multiple people and we booked separate flights. Sometimes we have taken turns booking
              accommodation so the confirmations are with different people - Survey Respondent #13</div>
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>My original hypothesis was to have this app be sort of a Google Drive type place for saving your own trip
            information, but after talking with potential users it sounds like having a social aspect could be helpful. </p>
          <p>If people can connect their plans to their friend’s plans it would make it easier to plan a group trip and
            keep track of everyone’s information. </p>
            <br><br>
          <p>In the interviews I asked how people currently keep track of group trips and it sounds like Google Docs is
            the most common place:</p>
            <div class="indent"><span class="quote">“</span>Most recently for a trip with my two best friends, we split
              planning responsibilities. One person focused on restaurants and dining, one person booked lodging, and
              one person planned all activities/sightseeing. We shared all information in a shared Google doc. - Interviewee #2</div>
              <br>
            and
            <div class="indent"><br> <span class="quote">“</span>My last group trip we had a google doc where everyone
              contributed information and things they wanted to do and see. Usually, when we are in the country we have
              a group chat happening on messenger. We all send links to restaurants and sights/activities (from google
              maps) and everyone decides together which ones look best. - Interviewee #4</div>
          <p>Another thing I asked people about in the interviews was whether they brought a laptop on trips and whether
            they got some kind of data plan for international travel. I wanted to see if this was something people would
             want as a website (because all of them said they do at least of their trip planning on a laptop or desktop).
             The general consensus was that they sometimes bring a laptop depending on the length of the trip and where
             they're going/staying. Four out of five said they've had a data plan on international trips in the past,
             but that they don't always get one due to the extra cost.</p>
            <p>All five of the interview participants said they bring their phone on trips, so it makes the most sense
              to have this be an app that can store information without them needing to be online to use it.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p><h3>TL;DR - I had 29 people complete a survey and I did 5 interviews to get more information. The maim
              thing I learned is that people are overwhelmed with the amount of things there are to keep track of when
              they're planning a trip. For this project I’m focusing on creating an app to organize trip documentation and
              information, and share it easily with the people you're traveling with.</h3></p>

          <h2>Competitive Analysis: What’s everybody else doing?</h2>
            <p>I did a competitive analysis of three sites using some of the heuristics in
              <a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/10-usability-heuristics-for-user-interface-design" target="_blank">
                Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics</a>.</p>

                <p>I did a competitive analysis of three sites so I could get an idea of what other companies are doing.</p>

                <p>Sites I reviewed:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><a href="http://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> (because they make it easy to keep lots of
                  information organized and easy to view)</li>
                <li><a href="http://lonelyplanet.com" target="_blank">Lonely Planet</a> (because they’re a place a lot
                  of people go when they’re planning for a trip)</li>
                <li><a href="http://get.google.com/trips/" target="_blank">Google Trips</a> (because Google knows how to
                  make things easy to use)</li>
                </ol>

                <img src="../images/googlesmall.png" alt="screenshot of Google Trips' site">


                <p>Findings:</p>
                <p>Trello is great at progressive disclosure because the focus is on the cards and boards. You have to
                  click or swipe to edit or view more information. They also make it easy to add a new card to a board
                  or move a card from one place to another.</p>
                <p>Lonely Planet is really focused on aesthetics and their site is really nice to look at. They have
                  great pictures and a lot of white space, so it looks really clean. </p>
                <p>Google Trips is also good at progressive disclosure. The focus is on the main trip and the rest of
                  the information is hidden, so you either need to click on a picture or a dot-menu to find it. They have
                  different areas for specific categories within a trip.</p>

          <h2>Empathy Maps and Personas: Who is this for?</h2>
          <p>After my early research I was ready to begin consolidating everything I’d learned and figure out who this
            project’s target audience is. </p>
          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>I know personas can be controversial, but they’re helpful for me because I naturally come up with a lot of
            “what ifs” and edge cases when I’m working on a project. Having specific personas makes it harder for me to
            add something “just in case” because I have to decide whether one of my personas would actually use it. </p>
          <p>This (hopefully) keeps me from adding unnecessary things into what I create, and makes the interface simpler
            than it would be if I was allowed to run free!</p>
          <p>People of all different age ranges, backgrounds, and tech levels use the internet to plan trips, and I’d
            like this app to be accessible to a wide audience. My survey responses came from a wide range of ages
            (under 20 to 60s), and 68% of the people who responded take between 1 and 4 trips a year, so I wanted to
            focus on different age groups, and have both of the trip amounts be within the 1-4 range. I also wanted to
            have one persona who likes to plan and one who doesn't. That way I'll design with enough simplicity that
            a person who isn't very organized can still use it, and I'll add enough options to keep a person who likes
            to plan happy.</p>
          <p>I made two personas: Tim, a young extravert who likes to travel with friends, and Mary, an organized
            professional in her 40s who splits her vacations between solo trips and trips with her boyfriend.</p>
            <br>

            <img src="../images/Timpersona.png" alt="screenshot of a persona for Tim">
            <br><br>
          <h3>Empathy Maps</h3>
          <p>The empathy maps show what each person would be thinking, saying, feeling, and doing while they're trip
            planning. These are useful to have because the personas focus more on demographic info and what type of
            person each of them are, and the empathy maps actually get into their mindset and process. </p>

          <h2>User Stories: How will people use this?</h2>
            <p>After making the personas I had an idea of what kinds of people would be using this, so then it was time
               to figure out how they’d use it. </p>
            <p>I went through the process of figuring out what the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)/Earliest Testable Product
              (ETP) and wrote users stories based on that. The MVP/ETP for this is a simple place for users to store trip
              information. I also added user stories for the user to connect with other people’s accounts. In a real
              world situation that might be a second round/stretch goal addition. </p>
            <h3>First Round</h3>
            <p>My first user stories were in the typical “As a user I want to ________ so I can _______”.</p>

              See the PDF version of those user stories</a> (opens in a new tab)</p>

            <h3>Second Round</h3>
            <p>After I’d finished them I read a <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/write-smarter-user-stories-product-design-development/"
              target="_blank">Joe Natoli article on UXPin</a> about shifting user stories to include more information
              that adds intent behind what they want to do. It’s useful because it shows what success means in the context.</p>
            <p>I decided to rewrite my user stories in this type of format to add some reasoning behind why a user would
              make the decision to use this product. I used my personas and walked through how they would use the app. </p>

          <h2>Information Architecture: How should this be laid out?</h2>
          <h3>Card Sort</h3>
          <p>My next step was to find out how people expect this app to function, so I did a card sort using
            <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort" target="_blank">Optimal Workshop's Optimal Sort</a>.</p>
          <p>I asked participants to sort 21 cards into groups that they named themselves. I had 10 people complete the
            card sort.</p>
          <p><img src="../images/Cardsortscreenshot.png" alt="screenshot showing the text from the 21 cards in the card sort"></p>
          <p>The responses to this were really interesting. People could create their own groups for the cards, so that
            gave them freedom to sort the cards however it made sense to them.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Account/Profile - (#15, #17, #18) These responses were pretty straightforward and almost all the
                participants labeled and sorted them in a similar way. Some people separated out Settings and others
                combined them with the Account/Profile cards. </li>
              <li>Social - I included two cards that referenced connecting with friends on the app (#16 and #21) which
                were pretty consistent about being under Social/Sharing headings. I also had one card that could be about
                a friend in real life or on the app (#2), so it looked like people put that in different groups based on
                their interpretation. </li>
              <li>Trip related - The trip related cards were sorted in different ways. Some people sorted them based on
                the actions being taken (Add New, Edit), and others sorted them based on what type of thing was being
                updated (Transportation, Activity, Lodging). A few people put a lot of the trip cards into one big Manage Trips/Trip
                Details category.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>I evaluated both of the options (organizing by what type of thing was being updated vs what action was
              being taken) and tried an IA in both ways. I got some feedback from my mentor and classmates at Springboard
              and determined that it would simplify the app to have it set up as Trip > Thing > Action. Since simplifying
              the trip planning process is a main goal of this app then structuring it in the simplest way makes the most
              sense.</p>

            architecture using that information and additional feedback.</h3>

          <h2>User Flows: How will people use this?</h2>
          <p>After the card sort and IA were done I wanted to do user flows so I could get a feel for how people would
            do things within the app. I went through a few flows and used my personas as examples of people who needed
            to do specific things.</p>
            <img src="../images/UserFlows-AddingANewTrip.png" class="userflowpic" alt="screenshot of a user flow showing how a user would add a new trip">
            <img src="../images/UserFlows-AddingTransportation.png" class="userflowpic" alt="screenshot of a user flow showing how a user would add a transportation item to a trip">

        <br><br>
        <p>This process made me focus on what a person would actually be doing. This was the point where I could start
          to see things coming together. It also made it so I could get specific feedback on how things were going to work.</p>
        <p>I was glad I hadn't tried to tackle all of people's travel issues in one app, because those userflows would
          have gotten pretty complicated. There are still lots of options and things to consider in this app, but since
          the goal is to simplify travel organization it's good to keep it streamlined.</p>

              <p>I used <a href="http://balsamiq.com" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> to make early wireframes. These were
                really fun to make because it started to feel real. It also helped to get a better idea of how it would
                feel to be a user of the app.</p>

              <p>I asked mentors, classmates, and survey participants for feedback on the first round of wireframes. I
                got lots of helpful information, ranging from quick fixes (I didn't have a "forgot password" link on my
                log in page) to super useful (I had overcomplicated the Connect With Friends process and I got great
                ideas that helped me simplify it). I also added Connect to the nav items at the bottom.</p>

          <h2>Protoyping: How would a user actually use this app?</h2>
          <p>Once I had created screens I could link them together to simulate the process a user would take as they
            plan a trip. I used <a href="http://invisionapp.com" target="_blank">InVision</a> to add "hotspots" to the
            screens in places where a user would want to click. </p>
          <p>I thought I had made enough screens in my second wireframe process, but I left out some that I thought were
            really similar to others (example: I had a View Activities page, so I didn't make a View Lodging page). But
            when I started linking screens in InVision I realized how important it was to really get a good idea of the
            flow, so I went back into Balsamiq and created the additional screens. This made the app feel so much more
            interactive because it was like I was actually using it.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility: What will make this app user friendly?</h2>
            <p>Part of user experience is knowing how to make products that are accessible, so I knew I wanted to learn
              about how to make mobile apps accessible.That wasn’t something the Springboard curriculum focused on, so I
              did some research on my own.</p>

            <h3>Mobile Accessibility</h3>
            <p>I wasn’t even sure if people could use screen readers on apps, so I had a lot to learn! I found some helpful
              articles (on
              <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/touchscreen-screen-readers/" target="_blank">NN/g</a>,
              <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/mobile/user-experience" target="_blank">BBC</a>,
              <a href="https://uxmastery.com/6-insights-for-designing-accessible-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">UX Mastery</a>, and
              <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/the-beginner-s-guide-to-accessible-mobile-ui-design-ca13a7342c27" target="_blank">Prototypr</a>)

              that gave me a better idea of what makes an app easy or difficult to use, and how to best design
              to minimize issues. </p>

            <p>People who can’t see the screen have to remember everything (or go back and listen again), so it helps to
              simplify wording and make sure everything is consistent and in the places they expect. Those things are
              beneficial for all users, so it’s good to design with them in mind!</p>

            <h2>Usability: Can people actually use this?</h2>
            <p>I had four people test the prototypes. It was great to see the prototypes on a phone, because it was in
              context for the first time.</p>
            <p>I was happy to find out that the app was simple enough for people to pick up quickly. I had them run
              through a few tasks to see if they could manage them even with a basic wireframe, and they could!</p>
            <p>I did get lots of really useful feedback, like that I needed a screen/modal for what happens after people
              add a new connection ("Does the screen just refresh or can you see their profile?"), and one person noticed
              that I didn't have a log out link anywhere, which is definitely something an app should have.</p>
            <p>I also learned a lot about how I need to make things in Balsamiq that will help me when
              I'm doing future projects. There isn't a way to upload your project from Balsamiq to InVision, so I ended
              up taking screenshots of each page in Balsamiq and uploading them into InVision. Since it was my first try
              with InVision I didn't realize there was an option to make an overlay, so on most of my screens the nav bar
              (with the Home, Connect, and Profile options) didn't show up until they scrolled down. This wasn't what they
              expected to see, and it isn't how I intend on having it look in the end, so now I'll know how to avoid having
              that happen in the future.</p>

          <h2>Style Guide: What will this app look like?</h2>
            <p>Once I'd gotten a good idea of how the app needed to work it was time to start thinking about how it
            should look.</p>
            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
            <p>I needed some inspiration for my colors, so I did a Google search for the words "trip" and "travel" to
              see what came up. Most of the pictures had similar colors (blues, greens, oranges/tans, and white), so
              that made it easy to choose colors.</p>
            <p>Since those are colors people already associate with traveling the color scheme of this app will fit in
              with their ideas of what travel "looks like".</p>
              <img src="../images/ssvacationsmall.png" alt="screenshot showing a Google image search for vacation pictures">
              <img src="../images/sstravelsmall.png" alt="screenshot showing a Google image search for travel pictures">
              <br><br>
              <p>I also knew I wanted a color scheme that would meet the WCAG AAA guidelines, so I used WebAIM.org's color
                contrast checker to determine what would work.</p>
                <img src="../images/colorlb.png" alt="screenshot showing a color contrast check on a lightblue color">
                <img src="../images/coloro.png" alt="screenshot showing a color contrast check on an orange color">

                <img src="../images/colorg.png" alt="screenshot showing a color contrast check on a green color">
              <br><br>
            <h3>Typefaces</h3>
            <p>Since this app is supposed to streamline the trip planning process and keep people organized it seemed
              fitting to have typefaces that were clean and simple. I went with two sans-serifs. The app also needs to
              feel relaxed and not clinical or stuffy, so the typeface for the headlines is Moon, which is rounded and
              feels more casual.</p>
            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>I chose the name Reika for the app (it means "wander" or "roam" in Icelandic). I'm not a graphic designer,
              so I decided to find a typeface that would add visual interest rather than attempting to make something
              that represented the name.</p>
