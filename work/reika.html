          <h2>Overview: What is this?</h2>
          <p>Reika is an app for organizing trip information. Trip planning can get overwhelming because there's
            so much to keep track of. In some cases you might book your flight and hotel on the same site, but when
            you add in restaurant reservations and activities you end up with lots of different emails and confirmations.
            Reika is a way to store all your trip information in one place so you can enjoy your vacation without hunting
            around for that piece of paper with your hotel's address on it when you're trying to fill out a customs form.</p>
          <p>This is my capstone project for the <a href="https://www.springboard.com/workshops/ux-design" target="_blank">
            Springboard UX bootcamp</a>. It isn't going to be a real app (unless you want to make it into one!).</p>

          <h2>Early Research and Findings: Do other people have issues with trip planning?</h2>
          <h3>Does anyone else have this problem?</h3>
          <p>I started this process knowing that I’d like a better way to keep track of all of my trip information. I
            wanted (and still want!) an app that lets me do trip planning from the vague “Top 10 Things To Do In ______” Pinterest
            posts all the way to the specifics of actually being on the trip. My early research focused on whether this
            is something other people also want.</p>
          <h3>Survey</h3>
          <p>I made a survey on <a href="http://typeform.com/" target="_blank">Typeform</a> to gather general trip
            planning information. You can
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZYfDzwaED7-2CulVLF1aSCNWZARs3UFy_HcETp1iiRE/edit?usp=sharing"
            target="_blank">view the questions I asked on this Google doc</a> or <a href="https://kaeanderson.typeform.com/to/R8hi5y"
            target="_blank">see the survey on Typeform</a>.</p>

          <p>Lots of people plan trips, so I didn't focus much on demographics. I asked how old they were and how often
            they went on trips to give context to the answers. The rest of the questions asked about habits and processes
            for organizing trip information.</p>
          <p>I had 30 people respond, and here are the main things I learned:</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>A lot of things about the trip planning process are less than ideal, which also means there are a lot of opportunities
                to make improvements. One of my survey questions asked about general trip planning challenges and the responses
                ranged from long immigration lines to the reliability of reviews online.</li>
              <li>Most respondents do at least some trip planning in advance (“some” in the survey meant having their
                transportation, lodging, and several things to do planned before they go).</li>
              <li>Information overload is an issue, both in the context of figuring out where to look for the best
                flights/hotels and also in keeping track of the information once they’ve booked their trip.</li>
              <li>Respondents find it challenging to plan if they’re traveling with groups (this wasn’t something I had
                specifically asked about - several people included it in their open responses).</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

            </div>
          </p>

          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <p>After doing the survey I wanted to ask some follow up questions to get more specific info, so I did interviews
            with five of the people who had filled out the survey. </p>
          <p>I asked open-ended questions about trip planning, and also talked about how they deal with group travel,
            since I didn't ask any questions about that in the survey. </p>

          <h3>Direction After Early Research</h3>
          <p>The answer to my original question “Does anyone else want a place to organize all their travel information?” is "kind of".
            People want ways to organize the information they actually want on the trip, but hardly anyone was interested
            in keeping track of every single thing from the beginning of trip planning, which (admittedly!) makes sense.</p>
            <br>
          <p>Responses to my open-ended question in the survey about trip planning challenges included things like:
            <div class="indent"><span class="quote">“</span>everything is booked separately, so it can be hard to have
              a single snapshot of your whole itinerary unless you make something yourself - Survey Respondent #2 </div>
              <br>
              and
              <br>
            <div class="indent"><br><span class="quote">“</span>Keeping all of the information organized. Especially
              if its a trip with multiple people and we booked separate flights. Sometimes we have taken turns booking
              accommodation so the confirmations are with different people - Survey Respondent #13</div>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>My original hypothesis was to have this app be a Google Drive type place for saving your own trip
            information, but after talking with people it sounds like having a social aspect could be helpful. </p>
          <p>If people can connect their plans to their friend’s plans it would make it easier to plan a group trip and
            keep track of everyone’s information. </p>
            <br>
          <p>In the interviews I asked how people currently keep track of group trips and it sounds like Google Docs is
            the most common place:</p>
            <div class="indent"><span class="quote">“</span>Most recently for a trip with my two best friends, we split
              planning responsibilities. One person focused on restaurants and dining, one person booked lodging, and
              one person planned all activities/sightseeing. We shared all information in a shared Google doc. - Interviewee #2</div>
              <br>
            and
            <div class="indent"><br> <span class="quote">“</span>My last group trip we had a google doc where everyone
              contributed information and things they wanted to do and see. Usually, when we are in the country we have
              a group chat happening on messenger. We all send links to restaurants and sights/activities (from google
              maps) and everyone decides together which ones look best. - Interviewee #4</div>
              <br>
          <p>Another thing I asked people about in the interviews was whether they brought a laptop on trips and whether
            they got some kind of data plan for international travel. I wanted to see if this was something people would
             want as a website (because all of them said they do at least of their trip planning on a laptop or desktop).
             The general consensus was that they sometimes bring a laptop depending on the length of the trip and where
             they're going/staying. Four out of five said they've had a data plan on international trips in the past,
             but three of them said that they don't always get one if they don't think it would be worth the extra cost.</p>
            <p>All five of the interview participants said they bring their phone on trips, so it makes the most sense
              to have this be an app that can store information without them needing to be online to use it.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p><h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)- I had 30 people complete a survey and I did 5 interviews to get more information.
              I learned is that people are overwhelmed with the amount of things there are to do, research, and keep track of when
              they're planning a trip. For this project I’m focusing on creating an app to organize trip documentation and
              information, and share it easily with the people you're traveling with.</h3></p>

          <h2>Competitive Analysis: What’s everybody else doing?</h2>
            <p>I did a competitive analysis of three sites using some of the heuristics in
              <a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/10-usability-heuristics-for-user-interface-design" target="_blank">
                Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics</a> so I could get an idea of what other companies are doing.</p>

                <p>Sites I reviewed:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><a href="http://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> (because they make it easy to keep lots of
                  information organized and easy to view)</li>
                <li><a href="http://lonelyplanet.com" target="_blank">Lonely Planet</a> (because they’re a place a lot
                  of people go when they’re planning for a trip)</li>
                <li><a href="http://get.google.com/trips/" target="_blank">Google Trips</a> (because Google knows how to
                  make things easy to use)</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="center">
                <img src="../images/trellosmall.png" alt="screenshot of Trello's site">
                <img src="../images/lpsmall.png" alt="screenshot of Lonely Planet's site">
                <img src="../images/googlesmall.png" alt="screenshot of Google Trips' site">
                </div>


                <p>Findings:</p>
                <p>Trello is great at progressive disclosure because the focus is on the cards and boards. You have to
                  click or swipe to edit or view more information. They also make it easy to add a new card to a board
                  or move a card from one place to another.</p>
                <p>Lonely Planet is really focused on aesthetics and their site is really nice to look at. They have
                  great pictures and a lot of white space, so it looks really clean. </p>
                <p>Google Trips is also good at progressive disclosure. The focus is on the main trip and the rest of
                  the information is hidden, so you either need to click on a picture or a dot-menu to find it. They have
                  different areas for specific categories within a trip.</p>
                <br><br>

          <h2>Empathy Maps and Personas: Who is this for?</h2>
          <p>After my early research I was ready to begin consolidating everything I’d learned and figure out who this
            project’s target audience is. </p>
          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>I know personas can be controversial, but they’re helpful for me because I naturally come up with a lot of
            “what ifs” and edge cases when I’m working on a project. Having specific personas makes it harder for me to
            add something “just in case” because I have to decide whether one of my personas would actually use it. </p>
          <p>This (hopefully) keeps me from adding unnecessary things into what I create, and makes the interface simpler
            than it would be if I was allowed to run free!</p>
          <p>People of all different age ranges, backgrounds, and tech levels use the internet to plan trips, and I’d
            like this app to be accessible to a wide audience. My survey responses came from a wide range of ages
            (under 20 to 60s), and 68% of the people who responded take between 1 and 4 trips a year, so I wanted to
            focus on different age groups, and have both of the trip amounts be within the 1-4 range. I also wanted to
            have one persona who likes to plan and one who doesn't. That way I'll design with enough simplicity that
            a person who isn't very organized can still use it, and I'll add enough options to keep a person who likes
            to plan happy.</p>
          <p>I made two personas: Tim, a young extrovert who likes to travel with friends, and Mary, an organized
            professional in her 40s who splits her vacations between solo trips and trips with her boyfriend.</p>

            </div>
            <br><br>
          <h3>Empathy Maps</h3>
          <p>The empathy maps show what each person would be thinking, saying, feeling, and doing while they're trip
            planning. These are useful to have because the personas focus more on demographic info and what type of
            person each of them are, and the empathy maps actually get into their mindset and process. </p>

          <h2>User Stories: How will people use this?</h2>
            <p>After making the personas I had an idea of what kinds of people would be using this, so then it was time
               to figure out how they’d use it. </p>
            <p>I went through the process of figuring out what the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)/Earliest Testable Product
              (ETP) and wrote users stories based on that. The MVP/ETP for this is a simple place for users to store trip
              information. I also added user stories for connection with other people. In a real
              world situation that might be a second round/stretch goal addition. </p>
            <h3>First Round</h3>
            <p>My first user stories were in the typical “As a user I want to ________ so I can _______”.</p>

            <h3>Second Round</h3>

              target="_blank">article by Joe Natoli on UXPin</a> about shifting user stories to include more information
              that adds intent behind what they want to do. It’s useful because it shows what success means in the context.</p>
            <p>I decided to rewrite my user stories in this type of format to add some reasoning behind why a user would
              make the decision to use this product. I used my personas and walked through how they would use the app. </p>

          <h2>Information Architecture: How should this be laid out?</h2>
          <h3>Card Sort</h3>
          <p>My next step was to find out how people expect this app to function, so I did a card sort using
            <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort" target="_blank">Optimal Workshop's Optimal Sort</a>.</p>
          <p>I asked participants to sort 21 cards into groups that they named themselves. I had 10 people complete the
            card sort.</p>
            <div class="center">
          <p><img src="../images/Cardsortscreenshot.png" alt="screenshot showing the text from the 21 cards in the card sort"></p>
          </div>
          <p>The responses to this were really interesting. People could create their own groups for the cards, so that
            gave them freedom to sort the cards however it made sense to them.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Account/Profile - (#15, #17, #18) These responses were pretty straightforward and almost all the
                participants labeled and sorted them in a similar way. Some people separated out Settings and others
                combined them with the Account/Profile cards. </li>
              <li>Social - I included two cards that referenced connecting with friends on the app (#16 and #21) which
                were pretty consistent about being under Social/Sharing headings. I also had one card that could be about
                a friend in real life or on the app (#2), so it looked like people put that in different groups based on
                their interpretation. </li>
              <li>Trip related - The trip related cards were sorted in different ways. Some people sorted them based on
                the actions being taken (Add New, Edit), and others sorted them based on what type of thing was being
                updated (Transportation, Activity, Lodging). A few people put a lot of the trip cards into one big Manage Trips/Trip
                Details category.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>I evaluated both of the options (organizing by what type of thing was being updated vs what action was
              being taken) and tried an IA in both ways. I got some feedback from my mentor and classmates at Springboard
              and determined that it would simplify the app to have it set up as Trip > Thing > Action. Since simplifying
              the trip planning process is a main goal of this app then structuring it in the simplest way makes the most
              sense.</p>

            do things within the app. I went through a few flows and used my personas as examples of people who needed
            to do specific things.</p>

            </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>This process made me focus on what a person would actually be doing. This was the point where I could start
          to see things coming together. It also made it so I could get specific feedback on how things were going to work.</p>
        <p>I was glad I hadn't tried to tackle all of people's travel issues in one app, because those userflows would
          have gotten pretty complicated. There are still lots of options and things to consider in this app, but since
          the goal is to simplify travel organization it's good to keep it streamlined.</p>

              <h3>First Sketches</h3>
              <p>I based the design on the information architecture and user flows. I made a few different versions of some

                got lots of helpful information, ranging from quick fixes (I didn't have a "forgot password" link on my
                log in page) to super useful (I had overcomplicated the Connect With Friends process and I got great
                ideas that helped me simplify it). I also added Connect to the nav items at the bottom.</p>

          <h2>Protoyping: How would a user actually use this app?</h2>
          <p>Once I had created screens I could link them together to simulate the process a user would take as they
            plan a trip. I used <a href="http://invisionapp.com" target="_blank">InVision</a> to add "hotspots" to the
            screens in places where a user would want to click. </p>
          <p>I thought I had made enough screens in my second wireframe process, even though I left out some that I thought were
            really similar to others (example: I had a View Activities page, so I didn't make a View Lodging page). But
            when I started linking screens in InVision I realized how important it was to really get a good idea of the
            flow, so I went back into Balsamiq and created the additional screens. This made the app feel so much more

            <h2>Accessibility: What will make this app user friendly?</h2>
            <p>Part of user experience is knowing how to make products that are accessible, so I knew I wanted to learn
              about how to make mobile apps accessible.That wasn’t something the Springboard curriculum focused on, so I
              did some research on my own.</p>

            <h3>Mobile Accessibility</h3>
            <p>I wasn’t even sure if people could use screen readers on apps, so I had a lot to learn! I found some helpful
              articles (on
              <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/touchscreen-screen-readers/" target="_blank">NN/g</a>,
              <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/mobile/user-experience" target="_blank">BBC</a>,
              <a href="https://uxmastery.com/6-insights-for-designing-accessible-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">UX Mastery</a>, and
              <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/the-beginner-s-guide-to-accessible-mobile-ui-design-ca13a7342c27" target="_blank">Prototypr</a>)

              that gave me a better idea of what makes an app easy or difficult to use, and how to best design
              to minimize issues. </p>

            <p>People who can’t see the screen have to remember everything (or go back and listen again), so it helps to
              simplify wording and make sure everything is consistent and in the places they expect. Those things are
              beneficial for all users, so it’s good to design with them in mind!</p>

            <h2>Usability: Can people actually use this?</h2>
            <p>I had four people test the prototypes. It was great to see the prototypes on a phone, because it was in
              context for the first time.</p>
            <p>I was happy to find out that the app was simple enough for people to pick up quickly. I had them run
              through a few tasks to see if they could manage them even with a basic wireframe, and they could!</p>
            <p>I did get lots of really useful feedback, like that I needed a screen/modal for what happens after people
              add a new connection ("Does the screen just refresh or can you see their profile?"), and one person noticed
              that I didn't have a log out link anywhere, which is definitely something an app should have!</p>
            <p>I also learned a lot about how I need to make things in Balsamiq that will help me when
              I'm doing future projects. There isn't a way to upload your project from Balsamiq to InVision, so I ended
              up taking screenshots of each page in Balsamiq and uploading them into InVision. Since it was my first try
              with InVision I didn't realize there was an option to make an overlay, so on most of my screens the nav bar
              (with the Home, Connect, and Profile options) didn't show up until they scrolled down. This wasn't what they
              expected to see, and it isn't how I intend on having it look in the end, so now I'll know how to avoid having
              that happen in the future.</p>

          <h2>Style Guide: What will this app look like?</h2>
            <p>Once I'd gotten a good idea of how the app needed to work it was time to start thinking about how it
            should look.</p>
            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
            <p>I needed some inspiration for my colors, so I did a Google search for the words "trip" and "travel" to
              see what came up. Most of the pictures had similar colors (blues, greens, oranges/tans, and white), so
              that made it easy to choose colors.</p>
            <p>Since those are colors people already associate with traveling the color scheme of this app will fit in
              with their ideas of what travel "looks like".</p>
              <div class="center">

            </div>
              <br><br>
              <p>One of the popular themes in app design is having colorful backgrounds with white text on them. I
                wanted to go that route as well, but when I checked the colors for accessibility I realized a lot of those color
                combinations don't pass. The background colors have to be really dark to be accessibly legible. </p>

                <p>Since lots of types of people plan trips it was important to focus on what improves the process for people,
                so I used WebAIM.org's color contrast checker to determine what would work.</p>

            <h3>Typefaces</h3>
            <p>Since this app is supposed to streamline the trip planning process and keep people organized it seemed
              fitting to have typefaces that were clean and simple. I went with two sans-serifs. The app also needs to
              feel relaxed and not clinical or stuffy, so the typeface for the headlines is Moon, which is rounded and
              feels more casual.</p>
            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>The name of this app is Reika (it means "wander" or "roam" in Icelandic). I'm not a graphic designer,
              so I decided to find a typeface that would add visual interest rather than attempting to make something
              that represented the name.</p>

            <h3>TL;DR - I chose colors based on what colors people associate with travel (that also meet the WCAG AAA
              guidelines) and chose typefaces that are clean and legible.</h3>

            <h2>Design: How should all of this be put together?</h2>
            <p>I had all the research done and the style guide finished, but I still had to do some work on figuring out
              how to best serve users with the visual design. I used Sketch to make these updated wireframes. </p>
            <p>It was important for me to keep in mind that this app is meant to streamline and simplify the process of
              organizing information. That meant white space was important and nothing should feel cluttered. If the
              design is messy it won't instill trust in a user that it can help keep things in order.</p>
            <p>I also made the decision to make a "light" mode (for when you're out in the sunshine) and a "dark" mode
              (for when you have to wake up at 3 AM to catch a flight).</p>
            <p>Based on the feedback I got during the prototyping phase I also changed a few other things. I changed the Home
              label on the nav bar to "Trips" because it wasn't super clear what "home" meant. And I switched the way the items are
              being displayed on the View pages (like the View Trips page), so now they're in a calendar form, because this
              seemed to be easier for people to skim.</p>

          <h2>Reflecting Back: What did I learn?</h2>
          <p>SO MUCH.</p>
          <p>This was my first largescale UX research project, and I learned a lot!</p>
          <p>Here are three main takeaways.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Keep things simple - After I started getting survey results back I knew there were lots of things people
              wanted to change about travel planning, and I started thinking about making a big app that tried to fix a
              lot of those issues. But the best apps do one thing well, so I narrowed my focus to creating a way to store
              trip information more effectively that a Google doc, and it made the process much less difficult than it
              would have been. And now that the MVP is done I could always add more things on to it if I found things
              people really wanted that fit into the scope.</li>
            <li>Little things matter - People get frustrated with products for what seem like minor reasons. But if
              they're repeatedly annoyed by something, and they're not required to use that product, then it's easy for
              them to stop using it and go in search of something better. Doing a lot of testing and getting user feedback is the
              best way to make sure people want to use a product. </li>
            <li>I am not my user - I'd definitely heard this before I started working on Reika, but it's so important to
              remember! Since I'm the only person working on this app I got used to my ideas about what it should do and
              how it should work. Getting feedback from survey participants, testers, other students, and my mentor was so valuable.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>And two other things I learned:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>I love that UX lets me use my curiosity and creativity for good. After graduating from a dev bootcamp
              I wasn't sure development was the career for me, and I was right - working earlier in the process
              and getting to do research with people uses my skills more effectively, so inclusve design is a much beter fit! </li>
            <li>There's an app called <a href="https://www.tripit.com/" target="_blank">TripIt</a> that I can use for
              travel organization in real life!</li>
          </ol>
