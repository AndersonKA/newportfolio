      <h1 class="maintitle">Updating A Default Mailchimp Sign Up Form</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="section" role="main">
      <div class="text">
        <p>I helped work on the WordPress site for a startup lifestyle blog called Kaizening. Lindsey, the owner and founder,
          uses Mailchimp for
          the email list, and she had added the default Mailchimp sign up form to the pages and posts on the site.
          It was important to have a form that looked professional and fit better with her blog because she wanted to
          improve her subscriber count, so she asked me to take on the project.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Default Form</h2>
      <p>The default Mailchimp form is pretty basic, but it does have some simple CSS giving it styling.</p>
      <p>It looks like this:</p>

      <br>

      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>I did some research on other lifestyle blogs to see what kinds of sign up forms they're using. Most sites seem to be using
      simple forms without a lot of "flashy" stuff. </p>

      <img src="../images/emailmelyssa.png" alt="screenshot showing Melyssa Griffin's email form - simple bright and cheery" title="Melissa Griffin's email form">
      <img src="../images/emailthisis.png" class="smallpic" alt="screenshot of This Is My Happiness' email form - clean and black and white" title="This Is My Happiness' email form">

      <br><br>
      <h2>What Kaizening Needed</h2>
      <p>Kaizening needed a form that would be a better match for the site than the default. I knew from the competitive analysis
        that site visitors will expect it to be simple and clean, so I created three quick mockups of the form to show
        the owner.</p>
      <p> The site has a relaxed feeling because it focuses on spirituality and self-improvement, so being bright and
        cheery wouldn't fit. And Kaizening's brand color is a tan/orange color, so I incorporated that into the forms as well.
        The goal of this form is to get people to sign up, so it needs to be noticeable enough that people will realize
        it's there without having to hunt for it.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Finished Product</h2>
      <p>I gave them to the owner and did a poll of other women who read lifestyle-type blogs, and the first
        option was the unanimous winner.</p>
      <p>After a few tweaks we had the final version, so I went onto WordPress and customized the CSS until the forms on
        the site looked just right. I also added aria labels to try to help out people using screenreaders since the
        fields aren't labeled.</p>
        <p>The form uses the brand color (C69f70) and fonts (Lato and Playfair Display), so it feels like it belongs on
          the site. And it's still simple, straightforward, and eye-cathing without having to be flashy or bright.</p>
      <p>Email sign ups have increased since the new form got added (after just two months in use the subscriber count
        has gone up by 30%!), so the form is serving its purpose and helping to bring in new subscribers. Success!</p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>It doesn't take a lot of time or work to make a positive difference!</p>
