          <h2>Global Service Jam</h2>
          <p></p>The <a href="http://planet.globalservicejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Service Jam</a> is a 48 hour long
          project where people from all
          over the world spend a weekend designing something that could improve people's lives. I joined the Nashville
          team to learn about service design and collaborate with my team on creating a solution for a problem. The jam
          was held in March and ran from 5PM on Friday to 3PM on Sunday in each location's local time.</p>

          <h2>Theme</h2>
          <p>Each year the GSJam has a theme that participants use to inspire their projects. This year the theme were
            the words "yes", "no", and "maybe" repeated with a glitchy background.</p>

          <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
          <p>There were six of us participating in the jam, plus several facilitators who work in the design industry.
            We spent some time doing word associations what the "yes no maybe" theme made us think of, and then grouped
            similar words together. After that we did another round of word associations and made some lists that we
            thought made sense.</p>
          <p>The first round we came up with words like "network", "social media", "connection", and "consent", and those
            turned into words like "perception", "belief", and "interference" in the second round.</p>

          <h2>Groups</h2>
          <p>We felt like we had good lists, so our lead facilitator, Taylor, had us pick which group (A, B, C, or D) we
            were each the most interested in. Three of us chose Group C and three chose Group D, so we used those
            as teams to start planning some interviews. We wanted to see what other people thought were issues and how
            they'd think about fixing them.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>My group came up with an idea: education + experience = perception. We decided that's what we wanted to
            focus on when we did interviews, so we worked on choosing questions that were open-ended so they'd (hopefully!)
            lead to good discussions.</p>

      <div class="section" id="interviewsection">

        <div class="text">
          <h2>Interviews</h2>
          <p>We wanted to do interviews with a variety of people, so we chose to go to Broadway in downtown Nashville.
            There are lots of tourists in that area and we knew it would give us access to a range of people.</p>
          <p>We ended up doing interviews with five (very kind!) people. None of the three of us had done guerilla
            interviews with people on the street before, so it was a little intimidating to go up to strangers. We made
            sure to let them know we weren't selling anything or trying to get them to sign up for something, and that
            made it a little easier. I was the official notetaker for the group, so I focused on making sure I had demographic
            information (in case we noticed a pattern), good quotes, and as much information about their body language
            and willingness to be open with strangers as I could.</p>
          <p>We got a good mix of people, and it was really interesting to see how their feelings on our topic differed.
            Most of our questions related to whether they thought education or experience had more impact on their lives
            and their perceptions.</p>
          <p>We ended up using three of the five as personas for the next steps in the design process:
            <ul>
              <li>Aaron is homeless by choice and sells the <a href="http://thecontributor.org/" target="_blank">The Contributor</a>,
                 (a newspaper sold by homeless or at risk people in Nashville so they have an income). He's on the
                 far end of the spectrum toward valuing experience because he thinks it's really important to learn by
                 doing things.</li>
              <li>Christy is a teacher and is also pursuing her PhD in education. She's on the opposite end of the spectrum
                because she clearly values traditional forms of education, but she did say she feels like there are a
                lot of issues with the way the education system works in the US (especially around funding).</li>
              <li>Matt works for a non-profit in Nashville. He's the middle ground of the two, because he's an outdoorsy
                person who likes experiencing new things, but he also did some student teaching when he was in school and
                really enjoyed getting kids excited about learning.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <br>
          <h3>Group D</h3>
          <p>The other group took a different approach to their interviews. They were interested in the title loan/payday loan market and
            what leads people to the point where they feel that's their best option (this goes back to the "yes, no,
            maybe" theme because they wanted to know if people had tried anything else first). They found that people who were using quick cash
            methods weren't willing to speak to them, so they talked to people who worked at one of the companies. They
            learned that for some people it's a way of life - they're regular customers who need money frequently, and
            that for other people it's due to a specific crisis (like a medical emergency), and that for those people
            going one time might make them turn into regulars.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <h2>Combining Information</h2>
            <p>After we came back from doing interviews we spent a little while going through what we'd learned from our
              interviews. Our team thought about how people could get "life experience" credits to help them get jobs
              without having to go to school. This was an interesting idea, but it would take a lot of buy-in from society
              as a whole, and would probably require a major cultural shift. Someone like Aaron (the man who is homeless
              by choice) has lots of knowledge that could make him a really useful employee, but it would be difficult to
              convince people that being homeless is "worth" the same amount as a degree.</p>
            <p>We decided to try combining the two groups so we could see if there was a way we could create a solution
              together.</p>

      <div class="section" id="solutionsection">
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Since the other team had a more specific focus (people who need financial assistance), we decided that would
            be a better direction. We came up with the idea of having a network of groups (non-profits, churches, lawyers,
            government teams) that could work together to help people in need.</p>
          <p>The solution includes three parts: an app for people who have access to technology, a brick and mortar
            location, and yellow booths (that look like phone booths) in different types of locations.</p>
          <p>Each one offers connection to professionals for a variety of issues, including financial, legal, and housing.
            They allow a person to talk to a representative right away, or to schedule a call or meeting for some time
            in the future. And since the people supporting this would be working together, it would be easier for the user
            to get to the right people faster than if they'd had to do their own research to find out who could assist them.</p>
          <p>We did some work on creating a prototype of the app and booth with paper and cardboard.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>Part of the design jam process is to get feedback on the initial prototypes to see what could be improved.
            One of our facilitators suggested taking the prototypes to a nearby coffeeshop and they let us put the booth
            inside (thanks <a href="http://www.redbicyclecoffee.com/woodbine.html" target="_blank">Red Bicycle</a>!). It fit in perfectly
            next to their phone booth!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="photos">
          <img src="../images/gstesting.jpg" class="shorter" alt="the yellow booth next to a red telephone booth">
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>People in the coffeeshop were curious about it (we heard a few people say "I wonder what that is?"),
            but we didn't have a lot of people coming up to us to ask about it. None of us were experienced with this
            kind of guerilla testing, and we didn't really want to bother people since Red Bicycle was nice enough to
            let us bring the booth inside, so we didn't approach anyone to ask them to check it out. If I do
            projects like this in the future I'll know that we need to be more proactive to get information.</p>
          <p>We did end up getting to talk with the owner of Red Bicycle and he was really helpful! He told us that
            baristas are kind of like bartenders. Since they have repeat customers they end up hearing lots of people's
            stories, and he actually thought something like a yellow booth would be used in a coffeeshop like his. He
            said customers come in to figure things out (or to forget about their problems), so if he had a booth in the
            shop he could suggest it to people as a resouce.</p>

          <h2>Follow Up</h2>
          <p>After we came back we decided to change the name. We wanted something that would let people know what it was,
            and Yellow Booth didn't provide any information. After half and hour of Googling and using a thesaurus we
            decided Support Link was a good fit. It tells what it does, explains that it's a way to connect to resources,
            and doesn't seem like it's asking people to donate money.</p>
          <p>We also filmed a short video to submit to the GSJam site, which you can watch here:

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>This project was really fun because I didn't know much about service design before. I had gone to a few
            <a href="https://www.meetup.com/code-for-nashville/" target="_blank">Code For
            Nashville</a> meetups in the past, but they weren't really focused on working on projects, so this was the first time I
            actually designed a product that was made to help people.</p>
          <p>I also learned a lot from the people that participated. The facilitators were really great at helping us come
            up with ideas and they knew when to run with an idea and when to keep brainstorming. I normally do a bunch of
            brainstorming and then when I run out of ideas I'll try to figure out something that will work. It was
            interesting to see how people with more experience can say "oh, there might be something there, let's keep
            going with that" during the brainstorming session. And having opinions from different perspectives and backgrounds (a couple
            of the people on our team are graphic designers) gave us a wider range of ideas than we would have had. I'm pretty
            sure that I wouldn't have come up with Support Link from the "yes, no, maybe" theme on my own! </p>
