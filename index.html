        <h2>I've always been curious about people. I got a degree in anthropology because learning about humans comes
          naturally for me.</h2>
        <p>I had a job working on a helpdesk where I got calls and emails from people who weren't able to understand
          how to use a site and database. I spent hundreds of hours training them, and knew there had to be a way to make sites
          that were intuitive and easy to use. I left my job and went to a bootcamp for front-end development, but
          while I was there I realized it's not a developer's job to care about the user!</p>
        <h3>Cue my love for UX! It takes my interest in people and mixes in technology and creativity - it's the perfect
          fit!</h3>
        <p>I've worked at a range of companies: one with two employees and one with over one hundred thousand, brand new
          startups and companies that have been around since before I was born, with fields from healthcare to landscaping.
          I can get the work done in any kind of environment.</p>

            <h2>Wondering what can I do for you?</h2>
            <p>I bring a user focused, empathetic mindset to my workplace because I care about how people work with products.
              And I'm great at keeping projects on track because I'm naturally organized. If you don't already have a
              system in place for project management then I'll create one for you!</p>
            <h3>We should talk!</h3>
            <p>I'm open to working at a company where user experience is a priority or working in an organization that's
              newly focused on users and trying things out for the first time. I love learning new things, so I'm excited
              to work on new things with new people.</p>
